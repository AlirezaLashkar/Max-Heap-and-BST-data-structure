# Max-Heap-and-BST-data-structure
In this project, I designed the heap data structure and binary search tree data structure. I also implemented Traversal functions in bst and sorting them in both data structures and functions to add nodes or remove specific nodes. I made the MaXHeap  with Python language and the binary search tree with C# language.
