# Max Heap 
Here we built MaxHeap and implemented the following important functions:
1- Insert Heap
2- Is Heap
3- Find Delete from Heap
4- Print Sorted Heap
5- Merge Heaps
6- Print kth Biggest Num In Heap
7- Heap to BST
## At the end of the work, we designed the BST class and converted MaxHeap to BST.
